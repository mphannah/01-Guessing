# 01-Guessing
This is the first project for class C220: Guessing Game

The player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. If they do not get it the game will tell them if their guess was too high or too low. With this knowledge the player must then determine what their next guess will be. This process continues until the player gets the right answer.
